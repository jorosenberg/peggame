# Background
The Peg Game can also be played on a triangular board that is filled with holes arranged into
rows and columns. In a typical game, a peg is placed into all but one hole. Moves are made by
"jumping" pegs - moving one peg over another into an empty hole on the board. The "jumped"
peg is removed. The game continues until all but the last peg have been removed from the
board or no valid moves remain.
